## Answering "What is your weakness?" with W A G Method

W A G = Weakness → Action Taken → Growth Mindset

✅ Goal: Show how self-aware, honest, and growth-driven you are  
✅ Avoid generic or fake-sounding responses  
✅ Focus on improvement and personal development

------------------------------------------------------------

❌ Weak Responses to Avoid:
- “I care too much”
- “I work too hard”
- “I’m a perfectionist”
- “I trust people too easily”

⚠️ These sound like disguised strengths. Instead, be real but thoughtful.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Use this structure:

1️⃣ Weakness  
Choose something real but not a core requirement of the role.  
Example: "I used to have difficulty delegating tasks."

2️⃣ Action Taken  
Talk about how you actively worked on it.  
Example: "So I started using task boards and learned to trust teammates more by clearly defining roles."

3️⃣ Growth Mindset  
Show you're improving and open to learning.  
Example:  
- "This is an area I’ve worked on a lot recently…"  
- "At one point, it was a clear challenge for me, but I’ve been more mindful of it since…"  
- "Here’s what I’ve done to manage it better…"  
- "It’s still a work in progress, but I’ve made consistent improvements."

------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Summary Response Example:

“I used to struggle with overcommitting because I found it hard to say no. It affected my ability to prioritize. So I started planning weekly using time-blocking, and I now assess urgency and importance before accepting new work. I’m not perfect at it yet, but I’ve made a lot of progress, and I’m continuing to improve with feedback from mentors.”

------------------------------------------------------------


## Interview Strategy: Matching the Job Description

✅ I’ve read the job description carefully  
✅ I understand what the role needs  
✅ I match the role through real examples and relevant experience  

🔁 Strategic Mirroring  
Reflect what the company is looking for by using their keywords, tone, and expectations in your responses.

🧠 Pro Tip:  
Use keywords directly from the JD when answering interview questions. Connect your projects and skills to the actual responsibilities listed.

“It didn’t go as expected, but it taught me more than any success.”  
“It was a tough experience that shaped how I approach problems today.”  
“I’ve become more self-aware and confident because of it.”

------------------------------------------------------------

> Differentiate Between:

- Failure: You tried and it didn’t work  
- Rejection: You applied, but were not selected  
- Redirection: Something didn’t work, but led you to a better path
