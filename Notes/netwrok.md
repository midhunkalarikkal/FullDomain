## `WEB` ##
===========
The web is like a giant network where every device (node) is connected through unique IP addresses. These IP addresses allow devices to find and communicate with each other, forming a web-like structure.

## `Protocols` ##
=================
Protocols are rules that define how data is sent and received over the internet. Here are some key ones:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for accessing and sharing web pages on the internet.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Allows uploading and downloading files between computers.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending emails.
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): Ensures data is broken into packets and delivered to the right destination over the internet.

## `Server` ##
===============

`Hardware Server`
----------------
A hardware server is a powerful computer or machine specifically designed to store, manage, and process data. It is built to handle multiple requests from clients over a network.

`Software Server`
----------------
A software server is a program or application that provides specific services to clients. It runs on a physical or virtual machine and listens for client requests to deliver the required data or service.

`Application Server`
-------------------
An application server is a platform or software framework that provides an environment for running specific applications and connecting them to databases, user interfaces, or other services.

`Client Server architechture`
------------------------------
The client computer makes an HTTP request to the server. The server analyzes the request, prepares a response, and sends it back to the client.

- For sending requests and responses, the communication uses the TCP/IP protocol.
- The data is sent in the form of packets, which are small chunks of the original data.
- Each packet has its own buffer to ensure it is received and reassembled in the correct order at both ends (client and server).
- The connection between the client and the server is established using a socket.
- the HTTP request is also sent as packets over the TCP/IP protocol.

Inside the hardware server we can create multiple server application which are listening, and the port number is that the thing is differencing these multiple servers

`DNS Server`
-------------
This is a server that converts the domain name in to ip address

`Proxy Server`
